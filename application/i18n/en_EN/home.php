Just like in the 7th opus, the fun of the game lies in the many exciting races that you chocobo will run. You will also see it evolve through its training, its competitions, and increase its rank to face challenging adversaries every time. And if you succeed in finishing among the top competitors, you will receive great prizes, like objects and equipment that will prove very useful to your chocobo!",
    'text2'  => "But your chocobo also has limitations and as soon as it is exhausted, you will have to revitalize it by buying various vegetables in the shop. You will also earn money by placing bets on the races, by trying to predict the winners. Later on, you will have the option to buy a charming companion for your chocobo, so that in the end they can have babies and grow your stable and, if you are lucky, witness the birth of a colored chocobo! Some Ancients speak of a mysterious legend that tells of a mystical gold chocobo with incredible abilities! Race after race, become famous, in the magical universe of Chocobo Riding!",
